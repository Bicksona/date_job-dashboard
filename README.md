# 📊 Data Jobs Dashboard (Power BI Project)

This project is a **Power BI Dashboard** created as part of my learning journey with Power BI.  
The dashboard provides insights into the **Data Jobs Market**, including job counts, salaries, job trends, and global job distribution.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The **Data Jobs Dashboard** analyzes various job titles in the data domain (Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.) and highlights key metrics such as:
- Total job postings and average job ratings  
- Median yearly and hourly salaries  
- Job counts by title  
- Trends in job postings over time  
- Salary vs. hourly pay distribution  
- Job statistics (salary, hourly rate, and trends per title)  
- Drill-through analysis for deeper insights (e.g., Data Engineer jobs globally, platforms, schedule type)
